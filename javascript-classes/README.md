# Javascript Classes

This project was created with the aim of teaching programming to a group of friends, starting from scratch and progressing towards building a CRUD application using JavaScript, Express, React, PostgreSQL, and more.

## Description

The main objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive introduction to programming and web development using various technologies. The curriculum focuses on teaching the basics of JavaScript, server-side development with Express, front-end development with React, and database management with PostgreSQL.

The project is divided into multiple stages, starting from the fundamentals of programming concepts and gradually progressing towards building a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. Each stage introduces new concepts and technologies, building upon the knowledge gained in the previous stages.
